Colloquium: Emergent properties in plane view: strong correlations at oxide
 interfaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This Colloquium illustrates the essential features that make TMO-based heterostr
uctures an appealing discovery platform for emergent properties.
 The guiding principle is that strong electronic correlations in combination
 with the access to new symmetries and electronic band structures provided
 by oxide interfaces can activate new electronic properties formerly “hidden”
 in bulk compounds.

\begin_layout Subsection
ANATOMY OF AN OXIDE INTERFACE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formation of a coherent perovskite oxide heterointerface, as shown in
 Figure 1, provides a remarkable correlated electron “playground.” It brings
 different transition metal cations with their localized d electron physics
 and interacting charge, spin and lattice degrees of freedom into intimate
 contact in a tunable crystalline environment.
 The key structural features of transition metal oxides relate to the coordinati
on geometry 5 of the metal ions and the metal-oxygen-metal bond angles.
 These determine magnetic exchange interactions (Anderson, 1950; Goodenough,
 1955; Kanamori, 1965) and electronic bandwidths (Eng et al., 2003), thereby
 controlling the electronic and magnetic ground states.
 Structural and electronic changes across an interface can act to stabilize
 previously unanticipated phases of matter (Okamoto and Millis, 2004).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, the following degrees of freedom are highly tunable at an
 oxide interface and may be exploited in uncovering new phases: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Epitaxial strain mismatch owing to differences in equilibrium lattice
 parameters 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Atomic coordination frustration and cation site preferences
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Ordered spin and orbital states
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Charge flow across the interface (layer dipole discontinuities) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
• Chemical frustration and interlayer mixing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
CHARGE AT THE INTERFACE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding and controlling the distribution of charge carriers at the
 interface between dissimilar semiconductors is one of the pivotal developments
 of modern microelectronics (Gertner, 2013) important both for devices and
 as a crucial platform for discovery of remarkable physical phenomena including
 integer and fractionally quantized Hall effects as well as spin-Hall and
 other spintronic phenomena.

Electronic transport and dynamics in correlated heterostructures

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Transition metal oxides (TMO) have a variety of interesting phenomena caused
 by two competing tendencies of the valence electrons: one is to localize
 near the ionic position and the other to delocalize in the lattice.
 The reason for this behavior are the partially filled outer d-shells, which
 result in narrow electronic bands and increase the importance of electron-elect
ron interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The effects of the strong correlation are not limited to bulk properties,
 they can induce remarkable effects at the surface or at the interface of
 materials.
 Lately, the quest for a theoretical understanding of how bulk correlations
 influence the reconstruction of the surface electronic phase triggered
 a great deal of attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The development of time-resolved experiments triggered a huge interest in
 the nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in correlated systems.
 Attention is devoted to understand the mechanisms responsible for the dielectri
c breakdown of the Mott insulating state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Large electric field lead to both broken spatial and time translation invarience
 and the difficulty in treating on the same level inhomogeneity and real-time
 dynamics has slowed down the theoretical advance in this field.
 The initial steps focused mainly on stationary states in heterostructures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this work we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a strongly correlated
 heterostructure coupled to external metallic leads and driven out of equilibriu
m by a voltage potential bias.
 Using a suitable formulation of the time-dependent Gutzwiller (TDG) method
 we study the dynamics of the inhomogeneous system and its nonlinear transport
 properties.

After coupling to external metallic leads a formation of surface states
 with enhanced metallic character appears.

Ballistic propagation of the perturbation inside the slab leaves the system
 in a stationary state equal to the equilibrium one with an excess of double
 occupancy concentrated near the contacts and a enhancement of the quasi
 particle weight at the boundaries of the slab

“Awakening” dynamics of the living layer from the initial dead one in terms
 of a characteristic time scale which diverges at the Mott transition, this
 divergence identifies this time scale as the dynamical counterpart of the
 equilibrium correlation length

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Finite voltage 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formation of current-carrying stationary states in the presence of a ﬁnite
 voltage bias depends directly on the value of the coupling between the
 slab and the leads.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For weak coupling between the leads and the slab there are stationary currents
 ﬂowing in a wide range of bias.
 Conversely for large couplings a strong-bias regime in which the system
 is trapped into a metastable state characterized by an effective slab-leads
 decoupling is identified.
 This is due to an exceedingly fast energy increase and to the lack of strong
 dissipative processes in the Gutzwiller method, which prevents the injected
 energy from ﬂowing back into the leads and the current to reach a stationary
 value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Studying the current-bias characteristics in the range of parameter for
 which the system is able to reach a nonequilibrium stationary state: a
 crossover from a low-bias linear regime, which is universal with respect
 to the interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $U$

, to a regime with negative differential conductance typical of ﬁnite bandwidth
 systems is found.

Mott insulating regime for 
\begin_inset Formula $U>U_{c}$

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Following the same analysis of the metallic case: formation of evanescent
 bulk quasiparticles after a sudden switch of the slab-leads tunneling amplitude
 in a zero-bias setup.
 In this case, the living layer formation is accompanied by an exponential
 growth of the quasiparticle weight, suggestive of a strong feedback between
 the dynamics of the quasiparticles and the local degrees of freedom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the presence of a ﬁnite bias, we study the conditions under which these
 evanescent quasiparticles can lead to the opening of a conducting channel
 through the insulating slab.
 At very low bias this is the case only for a very small slab, for which
 the correlation length ξ is of the same order of the slab size.
 For larger samples we found that the currents are exponentially activated
 with a threshold bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V_{th}$
\end_inset

which increases with the slab size.
 This behavior is suggestive of a Landau-Zener type of dielectric breakdown,
 as found in previous DMFT studies and in agreement with equilibrium calculation
s of the tunneling amplitude for a quasiparticle through an insulating slab.
